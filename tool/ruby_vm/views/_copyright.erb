/*
 * This is  an auto-generated file  and is a  part of the  programming language
 * Ruby.  The author  of the generating program of this  file (``I'' hereafter)
 * would like to refrain from defining licensing terms of this generated source
 * code because  that of generating  program says nothing about  such generated
 * one.
 *
 * In general, this  file consists of many small parts  of codes copyrighted by
 * each authors, not  only the ``I'' person.  Because they  all agree with some
 * open-source license,  it is possible to  (at least) generate this  file then
 * use it.  I believe  the license we agree is in  fact the condition mentioned
 * in the file COPYING.   It states "4. You may modify and  include the part of
 * the software into any other software ...",  but never makes it clear if such
 * modified parts still remain in the same license, or not.
 *
 * I am just very judicious to say  something.  Perhaps it might turn out to be
 * okay to  redistribute this  file under  the same  license as  the generating
 * script someday.  I  wish the licensing of  this file would be  more clear in
 * future.
